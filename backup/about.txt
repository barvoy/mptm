About Us
Every Toastmasters club has a unique culture. It is important for prospective members to find the club they most resonate with. The Menlo Park Toastmasters club is characterized by five attributes: welcoming, supportive, informal, diverse and fun.

We strive to welcome all guests and make them feel comfortable and to support members and guests in their quests to become better communicators and public speakers. Although meetings follow a predetermined agenda with a focus on prepared speeches, evaluations of the prepared speeches and extemporaneous responses to questions that revolve around a theme of the day, the tone of our meetings is still friendly and casual.

Club members come from a wide range of professions including attorneys, real estate agents, scientists, therapists and designers. We have also had a number of techies and entrepreneurs. Ages range from the mid-twenties to early sixties. For a number of our members, English is a second language.

Although we are serious about and strongly committed to improving our communication skills, we have a lot of fun on that journey. Itâ€™s unusual for us to have a meeting without lots of laughter.

We invite you to join us as a guest at one of our meetings in order for you to experience the Menlo Park Toastmasters for yourself.

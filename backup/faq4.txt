10 Steps To Effective Listening – PART 1
Face the speaker and maintain eye contact.
Be attentive, but relaxed.
Keep an open mind.
Listen to the words and try to picture what the speaker is saying.
Don’t interrupt and don’t impose your “solutions.” Unless asked.
Wait for the speaker to pause to ask clarifying questions.
Ask questions only to ensure understanding.
Give the speaker regular feedback.
Try to feel what the speaker is feeling.
Pay attention to what isn’t said—to nonverbal cues.

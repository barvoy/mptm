Gratitude
Did you know that gratitude has been scientifically proven to strengthen your immune system and make you happier and more optimistic, as well as less lonely and isolated?

Keep a gratitude journal;
Practice present moment awareness;
Think bigger than yourself;
Share the love with your family and friends; and
Replace complaints with gratitude.
What are you grateful for today?

This Tip of the Week comes from Whitney, Menlo Park Toastmasters member.

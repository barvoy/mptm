Welcome to
Menlo Park Toastmasters!

ABOUT THE CLUB

We are a diverse group of individuals from Menlo Park and surrounding areas all working together to improve our public speaking skills.

We believe the best way to improve your public speaking is to get up in front of people and speak: each meeting, everyone has an opportunity to speak in front of the entire club. Our meetings are relaxed and fun, but always educational. New members are paired with mentors to help develop their speaking skills.

Guests are always more than welcome to visit our club. Please contact president@menloparktm.org to find out more about the benefits of Toastmasters!

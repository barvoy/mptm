How to Switch Careers without Giving Up Your Seniority
Leverage the halo effect. Recognize that if you’ve been successful in one field, others are likely to view you as being excellent all around and a great candidate in another field.
Make use of your advantages. Take stock of the advantages you’ve built up over the years such as connections that can get you a foot in the door.
Find opportunities where inexperience is a virtue such as companies looking for a major turnaround.
